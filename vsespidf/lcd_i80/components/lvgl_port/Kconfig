            You can select one from those tested models, or you may add your own panel
            initialization register table inside components/bsp/bsp_lcd_panels.c.

        help
            This selects the pixel frequency of the driver. Higher frequency improves fps
            but may cause glitches in graphics or even prevent the screen from functioning.
            How high the frequency could reach depends on the hardware (route on the pcb,
            for example) and lcd driver chip specs. Choose as high frequency as possible
            while the graphics is fine.
